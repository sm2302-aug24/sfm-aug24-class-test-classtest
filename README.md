# Class Test using R

This in-class test is designed to test your R programming skills on the topics that we have learnt thus far. There are **TWO** parts to this test. Please read the instructions very carefully.

Time allocated: 1.5 hours.

- [Part 1](PART1.md)
- [Part 2](PART2.md)

## Instructions

**IMPORTANT! READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY**

- Write all of your R code in a single `solution.R`. **Only the code contained within this file will be assessed**.

- It is important that you name your functions and variables **as instructed**, as your solutions will be auto-graded.

- The code in your script file should be able to be run without any errors.

- Note that not only will you be graded on the correctness of your code but also on creativity, code styling, the proper use of GitHub, as well as following instructions. Therefore, ensure that you

   - Style your code correctly--Refer to the Tidyverse Style Guide at https://style.tidyverse.org/;
   - Use comments where appropriate;
   - Cite your sources (failure to do so will result in penalties for plagiarism).

- Besides the `{tidyverse}` package, you need not run any custom libraries. If you do so, the autograding may fail.

- Do NOT change any file names or the folder structure. Most importantly DO NOT edit the .csv file in the repo.

- Note that not only will you be graded on the correctness of your code but also on creativity, code styling, the proper use of GitHub, as well as following instructions.
